This is the home of the code of two different fuzzers published at academic conferences.
The first fuzzer is [Fuzztruction](https://github.com/fuzztruction/fuzztruction), allowing fuzz targets that consume input via file or stdin. The second fuzzer called 
[Fuzztruction-Net](https://github.com/fuzztruction/fuzztruction-net) is based on Fuzztruction but targets networked applications.
